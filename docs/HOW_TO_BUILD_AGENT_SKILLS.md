# How to Auto-Generate AI Agent Skills From Your API Docs

This is a write-up of the pattern behind this repo, generalized. If you
already have structured API documentation somewhere, you can turn it into
installable AI-agent "skills" with a small, boring pipeline instead of
hand-maintaining a separate context file. This doc is meant to double as
source material for a blog post — it explains *why* each piece exists, not
just what it does. For the Requiems-specific implementation details, see
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## The core idea

Treat an agent skill as a **build artifact**, not hand-written content. If
you already maintain structured docs for humans (OpenAPI, YAML endpoint
specs, whatever), you have a source of truth. A "skill" is just that source
of truth, transformed into the format an agent expects, regenerated on a
schedule, and shipped like any other package.

That reframing gets you two things for free that a hand-maintained
`AGENT.md` never has: it can't drift from reality (it's derived, not typed
by hand), and updating it is a CI job, not a task on someone's todo list.

## What a "skill" actually is

Across Claude Code, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot's agent-skills support, the
convention has converged on the same shape: a `SKILL.md` file — plain
Markdown, with a small YAML front-matter header for machine-readable fields
(name, and whatever else your agent's loader cares about) and a
natural-language body underneath. No proprietary schema, no SDK. That's a
deliberate design point worth keeping in your own implementation: the lowest
common denominator across agent tools is "a markdown file in a folder,"
so that's the compile target, not any one vendor's format.

## The pipeline, in five stages

This repo's version of the pattern is `requiems-api` (structured API docs)
→ `requiems-api-skills` (this repo, published as `@requiems/api-skills` on
npm). Mapped onto the general pattern:

**1. A structured source of truth.** Your API docs need to already be data,
not prose — YAML, JSON, an OpenAPI spec, a database table. If the source is
a Word doc or a wiki page, write that structured layer first; there's no
transforming free text reliably. Here, that's `apps/dashboard/config/api_docs/*.yml`.

**2. A pure transform function.** One function: takes the parsed doc, returns
a markdown string. No file I/O, no CLI parsing, no side effects — see
`buildSkillMarkdown()` in [`scripts/build/index.ts`](../scripts/build/index.ts).
Keeping this pure paid off directly: when this repo migrated its build
script off Deno onto Node, the entire markdown-building function needed
*zero* changes. Only the I/O shell around it (reading files, writing files,
parsing CLI args) had runtime-specific code to port. If you take one thing
from this doc, take this: the part of your transform that shapes output
should never touch a filesystem or a runtime API directly.

**3. A CLI wrapper around the transform.** Something you can run locally
with `node script.ts --source <dir> --output <dir>` and get the same result
CI gets. If you can't run your generator on your own laptop without
spinning up CI, you can't debug it either.

**4. A scheduled job that runs the transform and diffs the output.** Don't
try to track "what changed upstream" — that's stateful and fragile. Instead,
regenerate everything from scratch every time, and let `git status
--porcelain` tell you what's different. It's simpler, self-healing (a missed
run doesn't lose anything, the next run just produces a bigger diff), and
it's the one thing git is already good at.

**5. A human gate before anything ships.** Regeneration produces a pull
request, not a direct commit, and merging that PR is *not* the same event
as publishing a new package version. Two separate, deliberate actions:
"this reflects current docs" (merge) and "this is now public" (a maintainer
pushes a release tag). See [Current Architecture](DESIGN.md#current-architecture)
for the concrete version of this.

## Design decisions worth stealing (and their tradeoffs)

### One generated file per endpoint, not one per API

A single `skills/sentiment.md` covering ten endpoints means every regen
touches that one file, and a PR reviewer can't tell which endpoint actually
changed without reading the whole diff. `skills/<api>-<method>-<path>/SKILL.md`
per endpoint keeps diffs scoped: if only one endpoint's docs changed
upstream, only one file shows up in the PR.

### Gate the version bump on the actual diff, not the cron firing

A weekly job that always bumps the version — even when nothing changed —
produces a version-only PR every single week, forever. Diff `skills/`
first; only bump if there's a real change. No-op weeks produce no PR at
all.

### Decouple "merged" from "published"

The tempting version of this pipeline auto-publishes whenever `main`
changes. We deliberately didn't do that: publishing requires a maintainer
to push a `vX.Y.Z` tag by hand. The honest tradeoff is that it's an extra
step someone can forget — but it means nothing reaches the public registry
that a human didn't explicitly decide to ship, which matters a lot more
once real users depend on the package.

### Guard the publish step by cross-checking the tag against the package version

Before `npm publish` runs, verify the pushed tag's version actually matches
`package.json`. Costs three lines of bash; the alternative is discovering
the mismatch as a cryptic npm 403, or worse, successfully publishing the
wrong version.

### Keep the toolchain boring

This repo's transform script briefly ran on Deno while the rest of the
repo (`package.json`, publishing) was Node — motivated by Deno's nicer
`--allow-read`/`--allow-write` permission model for a script that reads and
writes files. In practice the script never touched anything untrusted, so
that sandboxing bought nothing, and running two runtimes meant two
lockfiles and an extra `setup-deno` CI step just to run one file.
Consolidating onto Node (using its native TypeScript type-stripping — no
`ts-node`, no build step) removed a whole toolchain for free. Don't pay for
isolation you don't need.

### A reviewer ping beats a broken review gate

GitHub's "request review from a team" API needs org-scope token permissions
that a workflow's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` usually doesn't have — it fails
with `Resource not accessible by integration` unless you provision a PAT or
GitHub App just for this. A plain `@org/team` mention written directly into
the PR body needs no special permissions and still notifies everyone on the
team; it just isn't an enforced approval gate. Whether that tradeoff is
acceptable depends on how much you trust "someone will look before merging"
versus needing GitHub to block the merge outright.

## Applying this to your own API

If you want to do this for your own API:

1. Make sure your API docs are structured data somewhere, not just prose.
2. Write one pure function: doc → markdown string, matching the `SKILL.md`
   convention (front-matter + body).
3. Wrap it in a CLI you can run locally.
4. Add a scheduled CI job: run the CLI, diff the output, open a PR only if
   something changed.
5. Keep publishing a separate, explicit step from merging — don't let a
   docs update silently become a public release.
6. Pick one runtime and stay boring about it.

This repo currently generates 60+ `SKILL.md` files from ~60 source YAML
docs, regenerated weekly with zero manual editing, published as a single npm
package. The pipeline that does it is under 200 lines of TypeScript plus
three GitHub Actions steps.
